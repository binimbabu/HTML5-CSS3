    <h3>Statue of Liberty</h3>
    <p>
      The Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World; French: La Liberté
      éclairant le monde) is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island
      in New York Harbor, within New York City. The copper-clad statue, a gift
      to the United States from the people of France, was designed by French
      sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and its metal framework was built by
      Gustave Eiffel. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886.

    <h3>The Great Wall of China</h3>
    <p>
      The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified
      Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally "ten thousand li
      long wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the
      historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China
      as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.
      Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with
      selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first
      emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many
      successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border
      walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty
      (1368–1644).

    <h3>London Bridge</h3>
    <p>
      The name "London Bridge" refers to several historic crossings that have
      spanned the River Thames between the City of London and Southwark in
      central London since Roman times. The current crossing, which opened to
      traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel. It
      replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a
      600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. In addition to the roadway,
      for much of its history, the broad medieval bridge supported an extensive
      built up area of homes and businesses, part of the City's Bridge ward, and
      its southern end in Southwark was guarded by a large stone City gateway.
      The medieval bridge was preceded by a succession of timber bridges, the
      first of which was built by the Roman founders of London (Londinium)
      around AD 50.

    <h3>Vatican City</h3>
    <p>
      Vatican City,[f] officially the Vatican City State (Italian: Stato della
      Città del Vaticano;[g] Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae),[h][i] is a
      landlocked sovereign country,[16][17] city-state, microstate, and enclave
      surrounded by, and historically a part of, Rome, Italy.[18][19] It became
      independent from Italy in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty, and is a distinct
      territory under "full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign
      authority and jurisdiction" of the Holy See, which is itself a sovereign
      entity under international law, maintaining the city-state's temporal
      power, governance, diplomatic, and spiritual independence. The Vatican is
      also a metonym for the pope, the Holy See, and the Roman Curia.[j][20]

    <h3>India Gate</h3>
    <p id="indiaGate">
      The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war
      memorial located near the Rajpath (officially called Kartavya path) on the
      eastern edge of the "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi. It stands as a
      memorial to 74,187 soldiers of the Indian Army who died between 1914 and
      1921 in the First World War, in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia,
      East Africa, Gallipoli and elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the
      Third Anglo-Afghan War. 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers
      and officers from the United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2]
      Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the gate evokes the architectural style of
      the ancient Roman triumphal arches such as the Arch of Constantine in
      Rome, and later memorial arches; it is often compared to the Arc de
      Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.
