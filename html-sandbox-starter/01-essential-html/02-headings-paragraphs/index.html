    <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
    <p>
      The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ -/ TAHJ mə-HAHL, TAHZH -⁠, Hindi:
      [taːdʒ ˈmɛɦ(ɛ)l]; lit. 'Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white marble
      mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh,
      India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan
      (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it
      also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of
      a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house,
      and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

    <h2>Qutb Minar</h2>
    <p>
      The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and
      victory tower comprising the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of
      Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs.[3]
      It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi,
      India.[4][5] It was mostly built between 1199 and 1220, contains 399
      steps, and is one of the most-frequented heritage spots in the
      city.[6][7][4] Qutab-ud-din Aibak initiated construction of the Qutub
      Minar, but only managed to finish the first level. Successors continued
      the construction, and, in 1368, Firuz Shah Tughlaq rebuilt the top parts
      and added a cupola.
