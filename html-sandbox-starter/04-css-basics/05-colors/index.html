          Taj Mahal - Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but
          work continued on other phases of the project for another five years.
          The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah
          Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of
          Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed
          in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around
          ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8
          million).
