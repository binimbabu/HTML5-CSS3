          was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the
          project for another five years. The first ceremony held at the
          mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the
          12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex
          is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost
          estimated at the time to be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be
          approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8 million).
